I'm fairly comfortable with Python at this point, I want to expand my skillset to include Java

This repository will be the code I generate as I work through the code for [Head First Java](https://smile.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208).

I'm working with the PDF version I bought in a [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/head-first-books) a while ago.

From page xxviii:
> much of the code from this book is available at [wickedlysmart.com](https://www.wickedlysmart.com/head-first-java/)
